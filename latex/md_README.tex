\subsection*{How to play}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item First choose if you want to Host a server(a) or Join an existing server(b)

a. When hosting a game you will be asked to set how many players should play.

b. You will be asked to input an ip address, this will make your client join the server inputted.
\item The lobby is where you wait for the other players to join
\item When it\textquotesingle{}s your turn, roll the dice and watch the magic happen
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{Program description}

The program uses T\+CP (Transmission Control Protocol) to send data to and from the server and clients. \mbox{[}$\ast$\mbox{]} More info to come

\section*{Assignment issues}

The assignment says to make two repositories, one for the client and one for the server, but we have only made one repository. This is due to the way the assignment was formulated, that you should be able to host a server, join and see available servers, all from the same lobby (executable). This seems sorely cumbersome, and completely unnecessary, not even mentioning two different repositories. In addition, the commit activities of each member should be taken with a grain of salt, as a lot of work has been lost (Not commited), because it simply didn\textquotesingle{}t work, or it was redundant before it was even committed. We have however tried to make each member active and producing during the entire process, this included evenly distributing the tasks, and give tasks to people who weren\textquotesingle{}t necessarily proficient in that area, to maximize learning outcome.
