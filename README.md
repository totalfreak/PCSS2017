# Assignment issues
The assignment says to make two repositories, one for the client and one for the server, but we have only made one repository.
This is due to the way the assignment was formulated, that you should be able to host a server, join one and 
see available servers. This seems sorely impossible using two different executables, not even to mention two different repositories.
